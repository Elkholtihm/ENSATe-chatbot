      "The document concerns the clubs of ENSA Tetouan. The ETP club, Presse ENSA Tétouan, brings together students to serve their school by creating a network through a website that shares exclusive information about students, clubs, and administrative announcements, fostering interaction between students and administrators while faithfully reporting events and updates. CETEC, a non‑profit club founded in 2012, is headquartered at ENSA and aims to nurture interpersonal skills and communication, public speaking, leadership, cultural awareness, and intellectual exchange among engineering students, especially those from sub‑Saharan regions, encouraging reading, writing, and diverse perspectives. Civil Engineering Club, created in 2016, offers engineering students a glimpse into the breadth of design careers and motivates them to pursue the field through learning and shared experience. ECHECS ENSATé, a sports club established by engineering students, focuses on promoting chess as a means to intellectual excellence, developing skills through teaching, practice, and competition, and is prepared to manage a structured program to achieve top performance and inspire others. Enactus ENSA Tétouan, part of Enactus Morocco since 2014, targets students with socially driven projects, building partnerships between local communities around Tétouan and higher education while upholding Enactus principles to prepare future ethical, entrepreneurial, and socially responsible leaders. ENSART, founded in 2016, is a student organization that gathers creative and inventive members to foster socio‑cultural growth, support artistic expression across the school, and collaborate with other clubs to enrich the extracurricular landscape. GRAFICA, one of the newest clubs created under the guidance of President Yasir Wahid and supervisor Mr. Belmir Brahim, unites students passionate about graphic design, aiming to sharpen creative skills, integrate engineering students into campus life, and offer collective video and photographic learning opportunities that meet the school’s graphic art needs. Hult Prize, a global competition, has taken place at ENSA Tetouan about two years ago and hosted two OnCampus Finals, the first held online due to the pandemic and preceded by workshops to help participants refine their pitches; the journey develops leadership, teamwork, and emotional intelligence as participants work through a full year of idea development, regional and national contests, and accelerators. InfoTech, a non‑profit scientific club founded in 2009 by engineering students, creates a supportive environment for academic growth through events and activities related to computer science and information technology. AFI, the “Future Engineers” association established in 2019 to formalize the Moovit club that began in 2016, is a social organization dedicated to helping the most vulnerable, driven by a group of motivated, sharing‑inclined individuals who aim to bring hope and support through various events. LEAVE IT HERE focuses on raising collective awareness of psychological and mental health among engineering students, maintaining anonymity and confidentiality while fostering solidarity, grace, and tolerance to create a supportive environment for personal and professional development. LOGISTICA, a non‑profit student organization, brings engineering students together around supply chain management, sharing knowledge and information to sharpen their skills and facilitate professional integration. MASJID, founded in 2013 by a group of students, is a non‑political extracurricular club that encourages spiritual growth and social responsibility, integrating religious values into daily student life, promoting self‑improvement, community support, and preparing members to become responsible citizens. Mécatronique, initiated in 2009 by students under Ms. Oussama Mahboub, is a scientific club that instills creativity and innovation through multidisciplinary projects involving mechanics, electronics, computing, and automation, linking theory with real‑world practice and preparing members for local, national, and international competitions. Rotaract, a service club for young adults aged 18 to 30, was created in 1968 in the United States and has since expanded worldwide; the ENSA Tétouan branch, formed in 2016, gathers proactive engineering students who embrace charitable and ethical values, encouraging community engagement, personal growth, and friendship while addressing material, social, and cultural needs. SPORT, established in 2010 by students from various cohorts, serves as a meeting place for all students regardless of discipline, background, or physical ability, promoting balanced engineering graduates who are socially adept and adaptable to diverse work situations. Wirenet, a non‑profit club founded for and by ENSA Tétouan engineering students under Professor Otman Aghzout El Idrissi, promotes the Telecommunications and Networking Engineering discipline, bringing together the necessary resources to help students launch their professional careers. AI Geeks, a community of students at ENSA Tétouan specializing in Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, explores, learns, and shares knowledge in these rapidly evolving fields.Saved augmented file: les clubs de l'ecole_reph.txt\n",

L’ENSA Tétouan, fondée en septembre 2008, fait partie du réseau des Écoles Nationales des Sciences Appliquées et constitue un établissement public à vocation scientifique, culturelle et professionnelle, conçu pour former des ingénieurs de haut niveau. Son objectif principal est de former des ingénieurs d’État immédiatement opérationnels, capables de s’adapter aux évolutions technologiques et aux mutations sociétales. L’école favorise l’insertion professionnelle des étudiants grâce à une pédagogie axée sur l’autonomie et une approche transdisciplinaire orientée vers l’innovation. En phase de maturité, l’ENSA Tétouan aspire à se placer parmi les meilleures institutions d’enseignement supérieur et à accroître sa notoriété dans le contexte socio‑économique.\n",
      "\n",
      "La structure pédagogique se divise en deux cycles : un cycle préparatoire intégré de deux ans suivi d’un cycle ingénieur de trois ans. Le cycle préparatoire, couvrant les deux premières années du cursus, permet aux étudiants de consolider leurs bases scientifiques tout en se familiarisant avec les techniques de communication, l’informatique, la technologie, les sciences humaines et la gestion d’entreprise, à travers cours, travaux dirigés et pratiques. La première année est intensive, tandis que la deuxième prépare les étudiants au cycle ingénieur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Le cycle ingénieur s’étale sur six semestres. Les cinq premiers semestres regroupent trois blocs de modules : les sciences, les techniques de base et la spécialisation, le management, et les langues, la communication et les technologies de l’information et de la communication. Le sixième semestre est dédié au Projet de Fin d’Études (PFE).

      "Le directeur, Kamal Reklaoui, souligne que le Maroc est résolu à consolider sa souveraineté industrielle tout en poursuivant sa transformation à travers de grands projets structurants tels que les LGV, le port de Tanger Med, le complexe Noor, Tanger Automotive City, la ville industrielle «Cité Mohammed VI Tanger Tech», la zone franche commerciale Fnideq et d’autres initiatives. Il observe que l’attractivité du pays et l’arrivée d’industries étrangères créent un cercle vertueux vers une industrialisation avancée. L’ancrage du tissu industriel national dans les chaînes de valeur mondiales a donné naissance à des spécialités à haute valeur ajoutée comme l’automobile, l’aéronautique et l’offshoring. L’économie mondiale, y compris marocaine, subit aujourd’hui de profondes transformations où l’intelligence, la digitalisation, l’industrie 4.0, les bouleversements de la connaissance et l’«ubérisation» sont au cœur. L’innovation devient le mot d’ordre, et les marchés se transforment selon une logique de disruption. Dans les dix prochaines années, entre 15 % et 40 % des métiers actuels pourraient disparaître ou évoluer, ce qui rend cruciale la formation des futurs actifs. En tant que directeur de l’ENSA Tétouan, je m’efforce d’impliquer tous les acteurs – étudiants, administrateurs, professeurs, professionnels – pour permettre une entrée réussie dans ce nouveau monde. L’enseignement supérieur et la recherche scientifique sont les leviers de la puissance et du rayonnement de notre pays. Nous formons des ingénieurs capables de s’adapter à divers environnements, d’acquérir continuellement de nouvelles connaissances et compétences, et d’apprendre à apprendre, en développant des soft skills et des power skills pour les rendre plus employables et désirables tant au niveau national qu’international. Nous encourageons une innovation pédagogique et numérique, en visant ce qui n’existe pas encore. Nos ingénieurs citoyens sont profondément attachés à leur pays, fiers de leurs valeurs et déterminés à réaliser des avancées sans précédent pour la nation, le roi et le peuple. La crise sanitaire du Covid‑19 a déclenché des réformes sectorielles dans le cadre du Nouveau Modèle de Développement, lancé par Sa Majesté le Roi Mohammed VI, favorisant le développement des compétences, des talents et du savoir-faire national, notamment à travers le «Made in Morocco» et le «Invented in Morocco», grâce à des projets sur le terrain, des investissements lourds (ports, autoroutes) et un travail acharné sur plusieurs décennies, ainsi que l’ouverture du pays par des accords de libre échange. En tant qu’école nationale formant les futurs ingénieurs, nous souhaitons contribuer à l’écosystème national en favorisant le «Made in Morocco» et le «Invented in Morocco» via l’amélioration de la recherche appliquée et la valorisation des résultats de recherche, afin d’intégrer le Maroc dans l’économie du savoir.\n",

      "This document concerns the file Manifestations Scientifiques.txt. It lists the scientific events of Ensa Tetouan, starting with the International Conference on Computing and Wireless Communication Systems (ICCWCS). The fourth edition of ICCWCS will be held from 21 to 23 June 2022 at ENSA in Tangier, part of the University of Abdelmalek Essaadi in Tetuan, Morocco, in partnership with the Association “MRSI”. The conference aims to create an excellent forum for discussion, the sharing of experiences, and the fostering of collaborations among the various working groups within engineering and information technology. It also provides a valuable platform for early-career researchers to publish and disseminate their work. All authors are encouraged to submit their communications, innovative research, or technological developments. The conference website is https://www.iccwcs.net/, and paper submissions can be made through https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=iccwcs22. For inquiries, contact iccwcs@uae.ac.ma. The next event is NDECS’2022, focused on composites, which are lightweight materials with outstanding mechanical properties used in aircraft, spacecraft, and civil engineering. Composite structures can suffer from various damage types, from localized defects to debonding, which can severely affect performance or lead to failure. Damage detection is crucial for monitoring initiation and progression, yet it remains challenging because the signals are highly sensitive to microstructure and noise, making early-stage damage difficult to detect. Therefore, more effective non‑destructive testing (NDT) techniques are needed. Following the successful first edition of the Non‑Destructive Evaluation of Composite Structures conference in November 2017 (NDECS’2017), whose proceedings were published in the Scopus‑indexed Matec Web of Conferences, the second edition seeks to bring together researchers and experts in the field of NDT for composites. The goal is to highlight recent advances and review current processes for damage detection in these structures, providing an opportunity to discuss and improve understanding of available NDT techniques. The conference is chaired by Abdellatif Khamlichi, and further information can be found at http://www.ndecs2022.com/NDECS/.Saved augmented file: Manifestations Scientifiques_reph.txt\n",
