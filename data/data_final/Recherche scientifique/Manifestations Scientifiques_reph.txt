This document concerns the file Manifestations Scientifiques.txt. It lists the scientific events of Ensa Tetouan, starting with the International Conference on Computing and Wireless Communication Systems (ICCWCS). The fourth edition of ICCWCS will be held from 21 to 23 June 2022 at ENSA in Tangier, part of the University of Abdelmalek Essaadi in Tetuan, Morocco, in partnership with the Association “MRSI”. The conference aims to create an excellent forum for discussion, the sharing of experiences, and the fostering of collaborations among the various working groups within engineering and information technology. It also provides a valuable platform for early-career researchers to publish and disseminate their work. All authors are encouraged to submit their communications, innovative research, or technological developments. The conference website is https://www.iccwcs.net/, and paper submissions can be made through https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=iccwcs22. For inquiries, contact iccwcs@uae.ac.ma. The next event is NDECS’2022, focused on composites, which are lightweight materials with outstanding mechanical properties used in aircraft, spacecraft, and civil engineering. Composite structures can suffer from various damage types, from localized defects to debonding, which can severely affect performance or lead to failure. Damage detection is crucial for monitoring initiation and progression, yet it remains challenging because the signals are highly sensitive to microstructure and noise, making early-stage damage difficult to detect. Therefore, more effective non‑destructive testing (NDT) techniques are needed. Following the successful first edition of the Non‑Destructive Evaluation of Composite Structures conference in November 2017 (NDECS’2017), whose proceedings were published in the Scopus‑indexed Matec Web of Conferences, the second edition seeks to bring together researchers and experts in the field of NDT for composites. The goal is to highlight recent advances and review current processes for damage detection in these structures, providing an opportunity to discuss and improve understanding of available NDT techniques. The conference is chaired by Abdellatif Khamlichi, and further information can be found at http://www.ndecs2022.com/NDECS/.
