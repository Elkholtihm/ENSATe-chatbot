On Monday, the schedule begins at 08:30 and runs until 10:00 with English 1 for group GR5 held in Salle 1 and Chemistry for group GR6 in Amphi 2. After a short break, from 10:30 to 12:00 English 1 continues for group GR6 in Salle 1 while Analysis is conducted for group GR5 in Amphi 2. The afternoon session from 14:30 to 16:00 features Algorithmique in Amphi 1 taught by A. Tahiri to Section 2.  

Tuesday opens with Analysis 2 in Amphi 1 for Section 2 from 08:30 to 10:00, followed by Algèbre 2 in the same venue for the same group from 10:30 to 12:00. In the early afternoon, from 14:30 to 16:00, Algorithmique is offered to group GR4 in Amphi 2 and Chemistry to the same group in Salle 1. The day concludes with two overlapping classes from 16:30 to 18:00: Analysis for group GR6 in Salle 1 and Algorithmique for group GR6 in Amphi 2.  

Wednesday’s timetable starts at 08:30 with Thermodynamique for group GR4 in Salle 1 and Algorithmique for group GR5 in Amphi 2, both lasting until 10:00.
