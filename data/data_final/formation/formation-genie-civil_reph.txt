This document concerns the civil engineering training program, specifically the engineering cycle in Civil Engineering, coordinated by Professor Khamlichi Abdellatif whose email is khamlichi7@yahoo.es. The curriculum is organized by module codes and titles, beginning with the foundational courses TC1 Languages and Communication 1, TC2 Management 1, TC3 Probabilities, Statistics and Stochastic Calculations, TC4 Computer Networks, and TC5 Graph Theory and Operations Research. Following these are the GC series of modules, ranging from GC1 Mécanique des solides déformables to GC31 Diagnostic, réhabilitation et maintenance, covering subjects such as topography with GIS and remote sensing, material strength studies, architectural fundamentals, fluid mechanics, land use and urban planning, geotechnical engineering, engineering geology, advanced mathematics and numerical methods, reinforced and prestressed concrete, steel construction, road engineering, finite element structure calculations, urban hydraulics, dynamic structures and seismic engineering, sustainable construction and energy efficiency, building thermal and acoustic performance, construction project management, bridges, dams and marine structures, and a final year project.
