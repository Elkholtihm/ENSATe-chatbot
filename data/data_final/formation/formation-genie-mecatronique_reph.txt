This document outlines the engineering curriculum for the Mechatronics program, coordinated by Professor Mustapha Snabi, reachable at mustapha_sanbi@yahoo.fr. In the first semester, students engage with linguistic and technical tools, foundational management concepts, probability and statistics, computer networking, relational database fundamentals, as well as graph theory and operational research. The second semester shifts focus to electronics, automation, mechanics, electrical networks and signal processing, energy studies, materials and RDM, alongside object‑oriented modeling and programming. The third semester introduces advanced mathematics and numerical methods, mechanical fabrication and production, initial machine design, mechanisms and robotics, a continuation of automation studies, further electronics coursework, power electronics and electrotechnology, and language and TEC components. During the fourth semester, the curriculum covers automation and supervision, actuator technologies, embedded electronics, automotive technology, industrial instrumentation and communication, a second phase of machine design, and a second management module. The final semester culminates with courses in mechatronic and embedded systems, quality and maintenance, product design and innovation, production management, a third management and communication module, as well as projects, internships, coaching, and the capstone final project.
