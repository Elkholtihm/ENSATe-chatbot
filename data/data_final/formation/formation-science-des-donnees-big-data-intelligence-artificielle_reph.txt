This document concerns the training in data science, big data, and artificial intelligence. The degree offered is an engineer of state in the field of Data Science, Big Data & AI. The main aim of the program is to prepare engineering students to gather, store, and process a wide variety of data, including massive and complex datasets, for the purposes of modeling, analysis, and value extraction. The artificial intelligence component gives students mastery of the most suitable techniques, methods, tools, and languages in the field, enabling them to design algorithms and models and to build systems and applications that incorporate the latest AI developments.  

Admission requires completion of two years of preparatory studies for the engineering cycle with a specialty in MP MIPC. Specific pedagogical prerequisites are two years of preparatory classes. Selection is carried out through a dossier review, a written test, and an interview. Access via bridges demands having finished two years of study after a scientific baccalaureate in one of the science faculties, specifically in the SMA, SMP or SMI options, and having a degree in IT from EST or an equivalent, as well as DEUSTs from the Faculties of Science and Technology in MIP or MIPC. Admission is contingent on succeeding in a competitive examination that includes written and oral components.  

The curriculum is organized over six semesters. In the first semester students study software engineering, database fundamentals, microeconomics and macroeconomics, data analysis and mining, management 1, languages, communication and ICT 1, and statistical and mathematical modeling. The second semester covers big data fundamentals, advanced algorithms and programming, numerical linear algebra for data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and languages, communication and ICT 2. The third semester focuses on database engineering, advanced operating systems, security, deep learning, and business intelligence. The fourth semester includes management 2, ethics and law, monitoring techniques, information theory, fundamentals of AI, web analysis, and AI applications. The fifth semester deals with networks and communication protocols, blockchain fundamentals, computer vision, entrepreneurship and innovation, knowledge engineering and the semantic web, and natural language processing. The final semester is devoted to the project de fin d’études.
